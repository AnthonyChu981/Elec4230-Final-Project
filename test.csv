231," Although he died young , Maxwell not only formulated a complete electromagnetic theory , represented by Maxwell ’s equations , he also developed the kinetic theory of gases and made significant contributions to the understanding of color vision and the nature of Saturn ’s rings ."
232, 3060 . We can get a good understanding of electromagnetic waves ( EM ) by considering how they are produced .
233," Whenever a current varies , associated electric and magnetic fields vary , moving out from the source like waves ."
234," 3090 . ( The axis is defined to be a line normal to the lens at its center , as shown in [ link ] . )"
235, Such a lens is called a converging ( or convex ) lens for the converging effect it has on light rays .
236," An expanded view of the path of one ray through the lens is shown , to illustrate how the ray changes direction both as it enters and as it leaves the lens ."
237, 3102 . Less diverging rays from a distant object can be converged for a clear image .
238, The distance to the closest object that can be seen clearly is called the near point of the eye ( normally 25 cm ) .
239," ( a ) The nearsighted ( myopic ) eye converges rays from a distant object in front of the retina ; thus , they are diverging when they strike the retina , producing a blurry image ."
240, This can be caused by the lens of the eye being too powerful or the length of the eye being too great .
241, 3105 . These are the rainbow of colors produced when white light is dispersed according to different wavelengths .
242, There are thousands of other hues that we can perceive .
243," These include brown , teal , gold , pink , and white ."
244," 3144 . An ideal radiator is one that has an emissivity of 1 at all wavelengths and , thus , is jet black ."
245," Ideal radiators are therefore called blackbodies , and their EM radiation is called blackbody radiation ."
246," It was discussed that the total intensity of the radiation varies as T4 , T4 , size 12 { T rSup { size 8 { 4 } } } { } the fourth power of the absolute temperature of the body , and that the peak of the spectrum shifts to shorter wavelengths at higher temperatures ."
247, 3150 . This decelerating process produces radiation that is called bremsstrahlung ( German for braking radiation ) .
248," The second feature is the existence of sharp peaks in the spectrum ; these are called characteristic x rays , since they are characteristic of the anode material ."
249, Characteristic x rays come from atomic excitations unique to a given type of anode material .
250, 3159 . There is another form of Heisenberg ’s uncertainty principle for simultaneous measurements of energy and time .
251," In equation form , ΔE Δt ≥ h 4 π , ΔE Δt ≥ h 4 π , size 12 { ΔE Δt > = { { h } over { 4 π } } } { } where ΔE ΔE size 12 { ΔE } { } is the uncertainty in energy and Δt Δt size 12 { Δt } { } is the uncertainty in time ."
252, 3189 . It was soon evident that Becquerel ’s rays originate in the nuclei of the atoms and have other unique characteristics .
253, The emission of these rays is called nuclear radioactivity or simply radioactivity .
254, The rays themselves are called nuclear radiation .
255," 3294 . We have noted in Particles , Patterns , and Conservation Laws that there are three flavors of neutrinos ( ν e ν e size 12 { ν rSub { size 8 { e } } } { } , v μ v μ size 12 { v rSub { size 8 { μ } } } { } , and v τ v τ size 12 { v rSub { size 8 { τ } } } { } ) and that the weak interaction could change quark flavor ."
256," It should also change neutrino flavor — that is , any type of neutrino could change spontaneously into any other , a process called neutrino oscillations ."
257," However , this can occur only if neutrinos have a mass ."
258, 2681 . There are two major systems of units used in the world : SI units ( also known as the metric system ) and English units ( also known as the customary or imperial system ) .
259, English units were historically used in nations once ruled by the British Empire and are still widely used in the United States .
260, 2948 . Drawings using lines to represent electric fields around charged objects are very useful in visualizing field strength and direction .
261," Since the electric field has both magnitude and direction , it is a vector ."
262," 2966 . In the first stage of the xerography process , the conducting aluminum drum is grounded so that a negative charge is induced under the thin layer of uniformly positively charged selenium ."
263," In the second stage , the surface of the drum is exposed to the image of whatever is to be copied ."
264, 2972 . A capacitor is a device used to store electric charge .
265, Capacitors have applications ranging from filtering static out of radio reception to energy storage in heart defibrillators .
266, 3008 . There is a variety of so - called ohmmeters that purport to measure resistance .
267," What the most common ohmmeters actually do is to apply a voltage to a resistance , measure the current , and calculate the resistance using Ohm ’s law ."
268," 3119 . An interesting thing happens if you pass light through a large number of evenly spaced parallel slits , called a diffraction grating ."
269, An interference pattern is created that is very similar to the one formed by a double slit ( see [ link ] ) .
270, 3140 . Rest energy is
271," 3275 . Before that time is the TOE epoch , but we have almost no idea as to the nature of the universe then , since we have no workable theory of quantum gravity ."
272, We call the hypothetical unified force superforce . Now let us imagine starting at TOE and moving forward in time to see what type of universe is created from various events along the way .
273," As temperatures and average energies decrease with expansion , the universe reaches the stage where average particle separations are large enough to see differences between the strong and electroweak forces ( at about 10 − 35 s 10 − 35 s size 12 { "" 10 "" rSup { size 8 { - "" 35 "" } } ` s } { } ) ."
274, 1838 . Cytokine Release Effect
275," The binding of PRRs with PAMPs triggers the release of cytokines , which signal that a pathogen is present and needs to be destroyed along with any infected cells ."
276," A cytokine is a chemical messenger that regulates cell differentiation ( form and function ) , proliferation ( production ) , and gene expression to affect immune responses ."
277," At least 40 types of cytokines exist in humans that differ in terms of the cell type that produces them , the cell type that responds to them , and the changes they produce ."
278," 1850 . NK cells are always active ; an interaction with normal , intact MHC I molecules on a healthy cell disables the killing sequence , and the NK cell moves on ."
279," After the NK cell detects an infected or tumor cell , its cytoplasm secretes granules comprised of perforin , a destructive protein that creates a pore in the target cell ."
280, Granzymes are released along with the perforin in the immunological synapse .
281," 1871 . An antibody , also known as an immunoglobulin ( Ig ) , is a protein that is produced by plasma cells after stimulation by an antigen ."
282, Antibodies are the functional basis of humoral immunity .
283, 1895 . Sexual reproduction starts with the combination of a sperm and an egg in a process called fertilization .
284, This can occur either inside ( internal fertilization ) or outside ( external fertilization ) the body of the female .
285, Humans provide an example of the former whereas seahorse reproduction is an example of the latter .
286," 1913 . The oviducts , or fallopian tubes , extend from the uterus in the lower abdominal cavity to the ovaries , but they are not in contact with the ovaries ."
287," The lateral ends of the oviducts flare out into a trumpet - like structure and have a fringe of finger - like projections called fimbriae , illustrated in [ link ] b ."
288," 1919 . FSH enters the testes and stimulates the Sertoli cells to begin facilitating spermatogenesis using negative feedback , as illustrated in [ link ] ."
289, LH also enters the testes and stimulates the interstitial cells of Leydig to make and release testosterone into the testes and the blood .
290," 1949 . Many organisms sink to the bottom of the ocean when they die in the open water ; when this occurs , the energy found in that living organism is sequestered for some time unless ocean upwelling occurs ."
291, Ocean upwelling is the rising of deep ocean waters that occurs when prevailing winds blow along surface waters near a coastline ( [ link ] ) .
292," As the wind pushes ocean waters offshore , water from the bottom of the ocean moves up to replace this water ."
293, 1952 . Temperature and moisture are important influences on plant production ( primary productivity ) and the amount of organic matter available as food ( net primary productivity ) .
294, Net primary productivity is an estimation of all of the organic matter available as food ; it is calculated as the total amount of carbon fixed per year minus the amount that is oxidized during cellular respiration .
295," In terrestrial environments , net primary productivity is estimated by measuring the aboveground biomass per unit area , which is the total mass of living plants , excluding roots ."
296," 1967 . These fishes can feed on coral , the cryptofauna ( invertebrates found within the calcium carbonate substrate of the coral reefs ) , or the seaweed and algae that are associated with the coral ."
297," In addition , some fish species inhabit the boundaries of a coral reef ; these species include predators , herbivores , or planktivores ."
298, Predators are animal species that hunt and are carnivores or “ flesh eaters . ”
299," Herbivores eat plant material , and planktivores eat plankton ."
300," 1991 . Malthus published a book in 1798 stating that populations with unlimited natural resources grow very rapidly , and then population growth decreases as resources become depleted ."
301, This accelerating pattern of increasing population size is called exponential growth .
302, 1997 . The successful ones will survive to pass on their own characteristics and traits ( which we know now are transferred by genes ) to the next generation at a greater rate ( natural selection ) .
303," To model the reality of limited resources , population ecologists developed the logistic growth model ."
304," 2003 . In another example , the chameleon can change its color to match its surroundings ( [ link]b ) ."
305," Both of these are examples of camouflage , or avoiding detection by blending in with the background ."
306, 2009 . Symbiosis
307," Symbiotic relationships , or symbioses ( plural ) , are close interactions between individuals of different species over an extended period of time which impact the abundance and distribution of the associating populations ."
308," Most scientists accept this definition , but some restrict the term to only those species that are mutualistic , where both individuals benefit from the interaction ."
309, 3331 . Some disagree with this theory and argue that genes do not set a limit on a person ’s potential .
310, Another perspective on the interaction between genes and the environment is the concept of genetic environmental correlation .
311," Stated simply , our genes influence our environment , and our environment influences the expression of our genes ( [ link ] ) ."
312," 3337 . Learning how the cells and organs ( like the brain ) function , help us understand the biological basis behind human psychology ."
313, The nervous system is composed of two basic cell types : glial cells ( also known as glia ) and neurons .
314," Glial cells , which outnumber neurons ten to one , are traditionally thought to play a supportive role to neurons , both physically and metabolically ."
315," 3652 . In addition to maintaining balance , the vestibular system collects information critical for controlling movement and the reflexes that move various parts of our bodies to compensate for changes in body position ."
316," Therefore , both proprioception ( perception of body position ) and kinesthesia ( perception of the body ’s movement through space ) interact with information provided by the vestibular system ."
317, 3655 . Another Gestalt principle for organizing sensory stimuli into meaningful perception is proximity .
318," This principle asserts that things that are close to one another tend to be grouped together , as [ link ] illustrates ."
319," 3664 . They tend to be simpler than instincts , involve the activity of specific body parts and systems ( e.g. , the knee - jerk reflex and the contraction of the pupil in bright light ) , and involve more primitive centers of the central nervous system ( e.g. , the spinal cord and the medulla ) ."
320," In contrast , instincts are innate behaviors that are triggered by a broader range of events , such as aging and the change of seasons ."
321," They are more complex patterns of behavior , involve movement of the organism as a whole ( e.g. , sexual activity and migration ) , and involve higher brain centers ."
322," 3676 . Now that you know how classical conditioning works and have seen several examples , let ’s take a look at some of the general processes involved ."
323," In classical conditioning , the initial period of learning is known as acquisition , when an organism learns to connect a neutral stimulus and an unconditioned stimulus ."
324," During acquisition , the neutral stimulus begins to elicit the conditioned response , and eventually the neutral stimulus becomes a conditioned stimulus capable of eliciting the conditioned response by itself ."
325," 3745 . THEORIES ABOUT MOTIVATION William James ( 1842 – 1910 ) was an important contributor to early research into motivation , and he is often referred to as the father of psychology in the United States ."
326," James theorized that behavior was driven by a number of instincts , which aid survival ( [ link ] ) ."
327," 3751 . Self - efficacy is an individual ’s belief in her own capability to complete a task , which may include a previous successful completion of the exact task or a similar task ."
328, Albert Bandura ( 1994 ) theorized that an individual ’s sense of self - efficacy plays a pivotal role in motivating behavior .
329," Bandura argues that motivation derives from expectations that we have about the consequences of our behaviors , and ultimately , it is the appreciation of our capacity to engage in a given behavior that will determine what we do and the future goals that we set for ourselves ."
330, 3754 . You use crystallized intelligence all the time in your coursework by demonstrating that you have mastered the information covered in the course .
331, Fluid intelligence encompasses the ability to see complex relationships and solve problems .
332, Navigating your way home after being detoured onto an unfamiliar route because of road construction would draw upon your fluid intelligence .
333, 3763 . Creativity is often assessed as a function of one ’s ability to engage in divergent thinking .
334," Divergent thinking can be described as thinking “ outside the box ; ” it allows an individual to arrive at unique , multiple solutions to a given problem ."
335, 3805 . The James - Lange theory of emotion asserts that emotions arise from physiological arousal .
336, Recall what you have learned about the sympathetic nervous system and our fight or flight response when threatened .
337, 3823 . Sigmund Freud ( 1856 – 1939 ) is probably the most controversial and misunderstood psychological theorist .
338," When reading Freud ’s theories , it is important to remember that he was a medical doctor , not a psychologist ."
339," 3826 . Through social interactions with parents and others in a child ’s environment , the ego and superego develop to help control the i d ."
340," The superego develops as a child interacts with others , learning the social rules for right and wrong ."
341, The superego acts as our conscience ; it is our moral compass that tells us how we should behave .
342," 3832 . In the above example , Joe made fun of a homosexual peer while himself being attracted to males ."
343," In regression , an individual acts much younger than their age ."
344," For example , a four - year - old child who resents the arrival of a newborn sibling may act like a baby and revert to drinking out of a bottle ."
345," 3922 . They view development as a lifelong process that can be studied scientifically across three developmental domains — physical , cognitive , and psychosocial development ."
346," Physical development involves growth and changes in the body and brain , the senses , motor skills , and health and wellness ."
347," Cognitive development involves learning , attention , memory , language , thinking , reasoning , and creativity ."
348," 3940 . When children learn new information , they adjust their schemata through two processes : assimilation and accommodation ."
349," First , they assimilate new information or experiences in terms of their current schemata : assimilation is when they take in information that is comparable to what they already know ."
350, Accommodation describes when they change their schemata based on new information .
351, 4078 . The branch of I - O psychology known as industrial psychology focuses on identifying and matching persons to tasks within an organization .
352," This involves job analysis , which means accurately describing the task or job ."
353," Then , organizations must identify the characteristics of applicants for a match to the job analysis ."
354," 4114 . The scientific study of how stress and other psychological factors impact health falls within the realm of health psychology , a subfield of psychology devoted to understanding the importance of psychological influences on health , illness , and how people respond when they become ill ( Taylor , 1999 ) ."
355," Health psychology emerged as a discipline in the 1970s , a time during which there was increasing awareness of the role behavioral and lifestyle factors play in the development of illnesses and diseases ( Straub , 2007 ) ."
356, 4249 . Bipolar and related disorders are a group of disorders in which mania is the defining feature .
357, Mania is a state of extreme elation and agitation .
358," When people experience mania , they may become extremely talkative , behave recklessly , or attempt to take on many tasks simultaneously ."
359, 3618 . An example of a monocular cue would be what is known as linear perspective .
360, Linear perspective refers to the fact that we perceive depth when we see two parallel lines that seem to converge in an image ( [ link ] ) .
361," Some other monocular depth cues are interposition , the partial overlap of objects , and the relative size and closeness of images to the horizon ."
362, 3798 . The correlations of IQs of unrelated versus related persons reared apart or together suggest a genetic component to intelligence .
363, The bottom is labeled “ Percent IQ Correlation ” and the left side is labeled “ Relationship . ”
364," The percent IQ Correlation for relationships where no genes are shared , including adoptive parent - child pairs , similarly aged unrelated children raised together , and adoptive siblings are around 21 percent , 30 percent , and 32 percent , respectively ."
365, 3801 . Dyslexia is the most common learning disability in children .
366, An individual with dyslexia exhibits an inability to correctly process letters .
367, The neurological mechanism for sound processing does not work properly in someone with dyslexia .
368," 3804 . Our emotional states are combinations of physiological arousal , psychological appraisal , and subjective experiences ."
369," Together , these are known as the components of emotion ."
370," These appraisals are informed by our experiences , backgrounds , and cultures ."
371," 3831 . Another defense mechanism is reaction formation , in which someone expresses feelings , thoughts , and behaviors opposite to their inclinations ."
372," In the above example , Joe made fun of a homosexual peer while himself being attracted to males ."
373," 4221 . Depersonalization is defined as feelings of “ unreality or detachment from , or unfamiliarity with , one ’s whole self or from aspects of the self ” ( APA , 2013 , p. 302 ) ."
374," Individuals who experience depersonalization might believe their thoughts and feelings are not their own ; they may feel robotic as though they lack control over their movements and speech ; they may experience a distorted sense of time and , in extreme cases , they may sense an “ out - of - body ” experience in which they see themselves from the vantage point of another person ."
375," Derealization is conceptualized as a sense of “ unreality or detachment from , or unfamiliarity with , the world , be it individuals , inanimate objects , or all surroundings ” ( APA , 2013 , p. 303 ) ."
376," 4227 . A person with schizophrenia may believe that his mother is plotting with the FBI to poison his coffee , or that his neighbor is an enemy spy who wants to kill him ."
377," These kinds of delusions are known as paranoid delusions , which involve the ( false ) belief that other people or agencies are plotting to harm the person ."
378," People with schizophrenia also may hold grandiose delusions , beliefs that one holds special power , unique knowledge , or is extremely important ."
379," 4266 . Rather , obsessions are characterized as persistent , unintentional , and unwanted thoughts and urges that are highly intrusive , unpleasant , and distressing ( APA , 2013 ) ."
380," Common obsessions include concerns about germs and contamination , doubts ( “ Did I turn the water off ? ” ) , order and symmetry ( “ I need all the spoons in the tray to be arranged a certain way ” ) , and urges that are aggressive or lustful ."
381," Usually , the person knows that such thoughts and urges are irrational and thus tries to suppress or ignore them , but has an extremely difficult time doing so ."
382," 3647 . In addition to the receptors located in the skin , there are also a number of free nerve endings that serve sensory functions ."
383," These nerve endings respond to a variety of different types of touch - related stimuli and serve as sensory receptors for both thermoception ( temperature perception ) and nociception ( a signal indicating potential harm and maybe pain ) ( Garland , 2012 ; Petho & Reeh , 2012 ; Spray , 1986 ) ."
384," Sensory information collected from the receptors and free nerve endings travels up the spinal cord and is transmitted to regions of the medulla , thalamus , and ultimately to somatosensory cortex , which is located in the postcentral gyrus of the parietal lobe ."
385, 3743 . What motivations underlie our behaviors ?
386, Motivation describes the wants or needs that direct behavior toward a goal .
387," In addition to biological motives , motivations can be intrinsic ( arising from internal factors ) or extrinsic ( arising from external factors ) ( [ link ] ) ."
388, 3959 . Research suggests that they do not .
389," People from an individualistic culture , that is , a culture that focuses on individual achievement and autonomy , have the greatest tendency to commit the fundamental attribution error ."
390," Individualistic cultures , which tend to be found in western countries such as the United States , Canada , and the United Kingdom , promote a focus on the individual ."
391," 3983 . Finally , children with disorganized attachment behaved oddly in the Strange Situation ."
392," They freeze , run around the room in an erratic manner , or try to run away when the caregiver returns ( Main & Solomon , 1990 ) ."
393, 3995 . The next stage of development is emerging adulthood .
394," This is a relatively newly defined period of lifespan development spanning from 18 years old to the mid-20s , characterized as an in - between time where identity exploration is focused on work and love ."
395, 4067 . Do you voluntarily help others ?
396, Voluntary behavior with the intent to help other people is called prosocial behavior .
397, Why do people help other people ?
398," 4259 . Cognitive theories of depression take the view that depression is triggered by negative thoughts , interpretations , self - evaluations , and expectations ( Joormann , 2009 ) ."
399," These diathesis - stress models propose that depression is triggered by a “ cognitive vulnerability ” ( negative and maladaptive thinking ) and by precipitating stressful life events ( Gotlib & Joormann , 2010 ) ."
400," Perhaps the most well - known cognitive theory of depression was developed in the 1960s by psychiatrist Aaron Beck , based on clinical observations and supported by research ( Beck , 2008 ) ."
401," 4280 . As is the case with other anxiety disorders , the panic attacks can not result from the physiological effects of drugs and other substances , a medical condition , or another mental disorder ."
402, A panic attack is defined as a period of extreme fear or discomfort that develops abruptly and reaches a peak within 10 minutes .
403," Its symptoms include accelerated heart rate , sweating , trembling , choking sensations , hot flashes or chills , dizziness or lightheadedness , fears of losing control or going crazy , and fears of dying ( APA , 2013 ) ."
404," 4283 . Alex suffers from generalized anxiety disorder : a relatively continuous state of excessive , uncontrollable , and pointless worry and apprehension ."
405," People with generalized anxiety disorder often worry about routine , everyday things , even though their concerns are unjustified ( [ link ] ) ."
406," 4326 . A good model to start with in economics is the circular flow diagram , which is shown in [ link ] ."
407, It pictures the economy as consisting of two groups — households and firms — that interact in two markets : the goods and services market in which firms sell and households buy and the labor market in which households sell labor to business firms or other employees .
408," 4341 . The budget constraint framework helps to emphasize that most choices in the real world are not about getting all of one thing or all of another ; that is , they are not about choosing either the point at one end of the budget constraint or else the point all the way at the other end ."
409," Instead , most choices involve marginal analysis , which means comparing the benefits and costs of choosing a little more or a little less of a good ."
410," 4347 . The budget constraints presented earlier in this chapter , showing individual choices about what quantities of goods to consume , were all straight lines ."
411, The reason for these straight lines was that the slope of the budget constraint was determined by relative prices of the two goods in the consumption budget constraint .
412," However , the production possibilities frontier for healthcare and education was drawn as a curved line ."
413, 4359 . Consumers who are looking for the best deals will encourage businesses to offer goods and services that meet their needs .
414," Adam Smith , writing in The Wealth of Nations , christened this property the invisible hand ."
415," In describing how consumers and producers interact in a market economy , Smith wrote :"
416," 4398 . A firm can build new factories and purchase new machinery , or it can close existing facilities ."
417," In planning for the long run , the firm will compare alternative production technologies ( or processes ) ."
418," 400 . The nuclear division that forms haploid cells , which is called meiosis , is related to mitosis ."
419," As you have learned , mitosis is the part of a cell reproduction cycle that results in identical daughter nuclei that are also genetically identical to the original parent nucleus ."
420, 4641 . Redistribution means taking income from those with higher incomes and providing income to those with lower incomes .
421," Earlier in this chapter , we considered some of the key government policies that provide support for the poor : the welfare program TANF , the earned income tax credit , SNAP , and Medicaid ."
422," 5226 . In the early 1990s , the United States was negotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) with Mexico , an agreement that reduced tariffs , import quotas , and nontariff barriers to trade between the United States , Mexico , and Canada ."
423," H. Ross Perot , a 1992 candidate for U.S. president , claimed , in prominent campaign arguments , that if the United States expanded trade with Mexico , there would be a “ giant sucking sound ” as U.S. employers relocated to Mexico to take advantage of lower wages ."
424, 5253 . Growth rates are frequently encountered in real world economics .
425, A growth rate is simply the percentage change in some quantity .
426, It could be your income .
427, 5277 . Each person who receives an additional dollar faces this choice .
428," The marginal propensity to consume ( MPC ) , is the share of the additional dollar of income a person decides to devote to consumption expenditures ."
429, The marginal propensity to save ( MPS ) is the share of the additional dollar a person decides to save .
430," 4637 . One set of explanations focuses on the changing shape of American households ; the other focuses on greater inequality of wages , what some economists call “ winner take all ” labor markets ."
431," We will begin with how we measure inequality , and then consider the explanations for growing inequality in the United States ."
432, Measuring Income Distribution by Quintiles
433," One common way of measuring income inequality is to rank all households by income , from lowest to highest , and then to divide all households into five groups with equal numbers of people , known as quintiles ."
434, This calculation allows for measuring the distribution of income among the five groups compared to the total .
435, 4655 . [ link ] shows the average wage of black workers as a ratio of the average wage of white workers and the average wage of female workers as a ratio of the average wage of male workers .
436," Research by the economists Francine Blau and Laurence Kahn shows that the gap between the earnings of women and men did not move much in the 1970s , but has declined since the 1980s ."
437," According to the U.S. Census , the gap between the earnings of blacks and whites diminished in the 1970s , but has not changed in 50 years ."
438, 4673 . There is a lot of human behavior out there that mainstream economists have tended to call “ irrational ” since it is consistently at odds with economists ’ utility maximizing models .
439, The typical response is for economists to brush these behaviors aside and call them “ anomalies ” or unexplained quirks .
440," 4700 . The U.S. insurance industry is primarily regulated at the state level ; indeed , since 1871 there has been a National Association of Insurance Commissioners that brings together these state regulators to exchange information and strategies ."
441, The state insurance regulators typically attempt to accomplish two things : to keep the price of insurance low and to make sure that everyone has insurance .
442, 4709 . A bond is a financial contract : a borrower agrees to repay the amount that was borrowed and also a rate of interest over a period of time in the future .
443," A corporate bond is issued by firms , but bonds are also issued by various levels of government ."
444," For example , a municipal bond is issued by cities , a state bond by U.S. states , and a Treasury bond by the federal government through the U.S ."
445, 4784 . The process by which capital ages and loses value is called depreciation .
446," The NNP can be further subdivided into national income , which includes all income to businesses and individuals , and personal income , which includes only income to people ."
447, 4799 . “ Standard of living ” is a broader term than GDP .
448," While GDP focuses on production that is bought and sold in markets , standard of living includes all elements that affect people ’s well - being , whether they are bought and sold in the market or not ."
449," To illuminate the gap between GDP and standard of living , it is useful to spell out some things that GDP does not cover that are clearly relevant to standard of living ."
450, 4808 . The first determinant of labor productivity is human capital .
451," Human capital is the accumulated knowledge ( from education and experience ) , skills , and expertise that the average worker in an economy possesses ."
452," Typically the higher the average level of education in an economy , the higher the accumulated human capital and the higher the labor productivity ."
453, 4408 . An example from the market for gasoline can be shown in the form of a table or a graph .
454," A table that shows the quantity demanded at each price , such as [ link ] , is called a demand schedule ."
455, Price in this case is measured in dollars per gallon of gasoline .
456," 4639 . The most plausible explanation is that while the explosion in new information and communications technologies over the last several decades has helped many workers to become more productive , the benefits have been especially great for high - skilled workers like top business managers , consultants , and design professionals ."
457," The new technologies have also helped to encourage globalization , the remarkable increase in international trade over the last few decades , by making it more possible to learn about and coordinate economic interactions all around the world ."
458," In turn , the rising impact of foreign trade in the U.S. economy has opened up greater opportunities for high - skilled workers to sell their services around the world ."
459, 4660 . The Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 prohibited discrimination on the basis of age against individuals who are 40 years of age or older .
460, The Civil Rights Act of 1991 provides monetary damages in cases of intentional employment discrimination .
461," The Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978 was aimed at prohibiting discrimination against women in the workplace who are planning to get pregnant , are pregnant , or are returning after pregnancy ."
462," 4699 . Rather than face such a situation of adverse selection , the insurance company may decide not to sell insurance in this market at all ."
463," If an insurance market is to exist , then one of two things must happen ."
464," 4747 . Indeed , these reasons are probably tied together , since people who do not believe their vote matters will not bother to become informed or care who wins ."
465, Economists have suggested why a utility - maximizing person might rationally decide not to vote or not to become informed about the election .
466," While a few elections in very small towns may be decided by a single vote , in most elections of any size , the margin of victory is measured in hundreds , thousands , or even millions of votes ."
467," 4756 . In the battle over passage of the 2010 Affordable Care Act ( ACA ) , which became known as “ Obamacare , ” there was heavy lobbying on all sides by insurance companies and pharmaceutical companies ."
468," However , a lobby group , Health Care for America Now ( HCAN ) , was financed by labor unions and community groups and was organized to offset corporate lobbying ."
469, 4774 . The gap between exports and imports is called the trade balance .
470," If a country ’s exports are larger than its imports , then a country is said to have a trade surplus ."
471," In the United States , exports typically exceeded imports in the 1960s and 1970s , as shown in [ link ] ( b ) ."
472," 4780 . To avoid this problem , which would overstate the size of the economy considerably , government statisticians count just the value of final goods and services in the chain of production that are sold for consumption , investment , government , and trade purposes ."
473," Intermediate goods , which are goods that go into the production of other goods , are excluded from GDP calculations ."
474," From the example above , only the value of the Ford truck will be counted ."
475," 4936 . The AD / AS model can convey a number of interlocking relationships between the four macroeconomic goals of growth , unemployment , inflation , and a sustainable balance of trade ."
476," Moreover , the AD / AS framework is flexible enough to accommodate both the Keynes ’ law approach that focuses on aggregate demand and the short run , while also including the Say ’s law approach that focuses on aggregate supply and the long run ."
477, 4951 . What Determines Net Exports?Recall that exports are products produced domestically and sold abroad while imports are products produced abroad but purchased domestically .
478," Since aggregate demand is defined as spending on domestic goods and services , export expenditures add to AD , while import expenditures subtract from AD ."
479," 5101 . First , PPP exchange rates are often used for international comparison of GDP and other economic statistics ."
480," Imagine that you are preparing a table showing the size of GDP in many countries in several recent years , and for ease of comparison , you are converting all the values into U.S. dollars ."
481," When you insert the value for Japan , you need to use a yen / dollar exchange rate ."
482," 5131 . [ link ] also shows the patterns of taxation for the main categories of taxes levied by the federal government : individual income taxes , corporate income taxes , and social insurance and retirement receipts ."
483," When most people think of taxes levied by the federal government , the first tax that comes to mind is the individual income tax that is due every year on April 15 ( or the first business day after ) ."
484," The personal income tax is the largest single source of federal government revenue , but it still represents less than half of federal tax revenue ."
485," The second largest source of federal revenue is the payroll tax ( captured in social insurance and retirement receipts ) , which provides funds for Social Security and Medicare ."
486, 5143 . [ link ] illustrates the process by using an aggregate demand / aggregate supply diagram in a growing economy .
487," The original equilibrium occurs at E0 , the intersection of aggregate demand curve AD0 and aggregate supply curve SRAS0 , at an output level of 200 and a price level of 90.One year later , aggregate supply has shifted to the right to SRAS1 in the process of long - term economic growth , and aggregate demand has also shifted to the right to AD1 , keeping the economy operating at the new level of potential GDP ."
488, The new equilibrium ( E1 ) is an output level of 206 and a price level of 92 .
489," 5146 . Each year , the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) calculates the standardized employment budget — that is , what the budget deficit or surplus would be if the economy were producing at potential GDP , where people who look for work were finding jobs in a reasonable period of time and businesses were making normal profits , with the result that both workers and businesses would be earning more and paying more taxes ."
490," In effect , the standardized employment deficit eliminates the impact of the automatic stabilizers ."
491, 5206 . Specialization in the world economy can be very finely split .
492," In fact , recent years have seen a trend in international trade called splitting up the value chain ."
493, The value chain describes how a good is produced in stages .
494," 5209 . For example , a single large automobile factory could probably supply all the cars purchased in a smaller economy like the United Kingdom or Belgium in a given year ."
495," However , if a country has only one or two large factories producing cars , and no international trade , then consumers in that country would have relatively little choice between kinds of cars ( other than the color of the paint and other nonessential options ) ."
496, Little or no competition will exist between different car manufacturers .
497," 5310 . Interactionist sociologist Clark McPhail ( 1991 ) developed assembling perspective , another system for understanding collective behavior that credited individuals in crowds as rational beings ."
498," Unlike previous theories , this theory refocuses attention from collective behavior to collective action ."
499, 5316 . The latter is still in existence despite government involvement that led to the deaths of numerous Branch Davidian members in 1993 .
500," Alternative movements are focused on self - improvement and limited , specific changes to individual beliefs and behavior ."
501, These include trends like transcendental meditation or a macrobiotic diet .
502," 5607 . We see the emergence of global assembly lines , where products are assembled over the course of several international transactions ."
503," For instance , Apple designs its next - generation Mac prototype in the United States , components are made in various peripheral nations , they are then shipped to another peripheral nation such as Malaysia for assembly , and tech support is outsourced to India ."
504," Globalization has also led to the development of global commodity chains , where internationally integrated economic links connect workers and corporations for the purpose of manufacture and marketing ( Plahe 2005 ) ."
505," For example , in maquiladoras , mostly found in northern Mexico , workers may sew imported precut pieces of fabric into garments . Globalization also brings an international division of labor , in which comparatively wealthy workers from core nations compete with the low - wage labor pool of peripheral and semi - peripheral nations ."
506," 5736 . Swedish sociologist Lars Tornstam developed a symbolic interactionist theory called gerotranscendence : the idea that as people age , they transcend the limited views of life they held in earlier times ."
507," Tornstam believes that throughout the aging process , the elderly become less self - centered and feel more peaceful and connected to the natural world ."
508," 5742 . One Partner or Many?People in the United States typically equate marriage with monogamy , when someone is married to only one person at a time ."
509," In many countries and cultures around the world , however , having one spouse is not the only form of marriage ."
510, 5414 . There are two ways to come across an innovative object or idea : discover it or invent it .
511, Discoveries make known previously unknown but existing aspects of reality .
512," In 1610 , when Galileo looked through his telescope and discovered Saturn , the planet was already there , but until then , no one had known about it ."
513," 5417 . As a result , world markets became dominated by multinational companies in the 1980s , a new state of affairs at that time ."
514, We have since come to refer to this integration of international trade and finance markets as globalization .
515," Increased communications and air travel have further opened doors for international business relations , facilitating the flow not only of goods but also of information and people as well ( Scheuerman 2014 ( revised ) ) ."
516, 5426 . Postindustrial Society
517," Information societies , sometimes known as postindustrial or digital societies , are a recent development ."
518," Unlike industrial societies that are rooted in the production of material goods , information societies are based on the production of information and services ."
519," Digital technology is the steam engine of information societies , and computer moguls such as Steve Jobs and Bill Gates are its John D. Rockefellers and Cornelius Vanderbilts ."
520," 5630 . Though social conformities still exist that encourage people to choose partners within their own class , people are not as pressured to choose marriage partners based solely on those elements ."
521, Marriage to a partner from the same social background is an endogamous union .
522," 5663 . Just as in the pre - Civil War United States , these humans are at the mercy of their employers ."
523," Chattel slavery , the form of slavery once practiced in the American South , occurs when one person owns another as property ."
524," Child slavery , which may include child prostitution , is a form of chattel slavery ."
525," 5693 . It is thought that her secretary supported this practice by suggestions to Ginsberg that “ those nine men ” ( the other Supreme Court justices ) , “ hear that word and their first association is not the way you want them to be thinking ” ( Case 1995 ) ."
526, This anecdote reveals that both sex and gender are actually socially defined variables whose definitions change over time .
527, Sexual Orientation
528," A person ’s sexual orientation is his or her physical , mental , emotional , and sexual attraction to a particular sex ( male or female ) ."
529," Sexual orientation is typically divided into four categories : heterosexuality , the attraction to individuals of the other sex ; homosexuality , the attraction to individuals of the same sex ; bisexuality , the attraction to individuals of either sex ; and asexuality , no attraction to either sex ."
530," 625 . For all of these reasons , pure culture is not always the best way to study microorganisms ."
531, Metagenomics is the study of the collective genomes of multiple species that grow and interact in an environmental niche .
532, Metagenomics can be used to identify new species more rapidly and to analyze the effect of pollutants on the environment ( [ link ] ) .
533," 634 . Hybrids can be either less fit than the parents , more fit , or about the same ."
534," Usually hybrids tend to be less fit ; therefore , such reproduction diminishes over time , nudging the two species to diverge further in a process called reinforcement ."
535, This term is used because the low success of the hybrids reinforces the original speciation .
536, 763 . Fossilized microbial mats represent the earliest record of life on Earth .
537, A stromatolite is a sedimentary structure formed when minerals are precipitated out of water by prokaryotes in a microbial mat ( [ link ] ) .
538, Stromatolites form layered rocks made of carbonate or silicate .
539, 784 . Prokaryotes can use different sources of energy to assemble macromolecules from smaller molecules .
540, Phototrophs ( or phototrophic organisms ) obtain their energy from sunlight .
541, Chemotrophs ( or chemosynthetic organisms ) obtain their energy from chemical compounds .
542," 817 . Some dinoflagellates generate light , called bioluminescence , when they are jarred or stressed ."
543, Large numbers of marine dinoflagellates ( billions or trillions of cells per wave ) can emit light and cause an entire breaking wave to twinkle or take on a brilliant blue color ( [ link ] ) .
544," 823 . Some fungal organisms multiply only asexually , whereas others undergo both asexual reproduction and sexual reproduction with alternation of generations ."
545," Most fungi produce a large number of spores , which are haploid cells that can undergo mitosis to form multicellular , haploid individuals ."
546," Like bacteria , fungi play an essential role in ecosystems because they are decomposers and participate in the cycling of nutrients by breaking down organic materials to simple molecules ."
547," Fungi often interact with other organisms , forming beneficial or mutualistic associations ."
548," 850 . Most members live on land , with a few aquatic exceptions ."
549, They form visible mycelia with a fuzzy appearance and are commonly known as mold . Reproduction of the fungi in this group is strictly asexual and occurs mostly by production of asexual conidiospores ( [ link ] ) .
550, Some hyphae may recombine and form heterokaryotic hyphae .
551, 5317 . These include trends like transcendental meditation or a macrobiotic diet .
552, Resistance movements seek to prevent or undo change to the social structure .
553," The Ku Klux Klan , the Minutemen , and pro - life movements fall into this category ."
554," 5491 . Mass media distribute impersonal information to a wide audience , via television , newspapers , radio , and the Internet ."
555," With the average person spending over four hours a day in front of the television ( and children averaging even more screen time ) , media greatly influences social norms ( Roberts , Foehr , and Rideout 2005 ) ."
556," 5539 . The student is reprimanded frequently by teachers and school staff , and soon enough , he develops a reputation as a “ troublemaker . ”"
557," As a result , the student starts acting out even more and breaking more rules ; he has adopted the “ troublemaker ” label and embraced this deviant identity ."
558, Secondary deviance can be so strong that it bestows a master status on an individual .
559, A master status is a label that describes the chief characteristic of an individual .
560," 5542 . In hindsight , we recognize that the laws that deemed many of their actions crimes — for instance , Rosa Parks taking a seat in the “ whites only ” section of the bus — were inconsistent with social equality ."
561," As you have learned , all societies have informal and formal ways of maintaining social control ."
562," Within these systems of norms , societies have legal codes that maintain formal social control through laws , which are rules adopted and enforced by a political authority ."
563, Those who violate these rules incur negative formal sanctions .
564, 5713 . There are several reasons why the United States is graying so rapidly .
565, One of these is life expectancy : the average number of years a person born today may expect to live .
566," When we review Census Bureau statistics grouping the elderly by age , it is clear that in the United States , at least , we are living longer ."
567, 5764 . A sect is a small and relatively new group .
568, Most of the well - known Christian denominations in the United States today began as sects .
569," 5791 . A more modern form of traditional authority is patrimonialism , which is traditional domination facilitated by an administration and military that are purely personal instruments of the master ( Eisenberg 1998 ) ."
570," In this form of authority , all officials are personal favorites appointed by the ruler ."
571, 5844 . His mother ’s complaints to the New York City Housing Authority were largely ignored .
572," In high school , Torres decided to become a lawyer , participated in mock trials , and met a young and aspiring local politician named James Vacca ."
573," After graduation , he volunteered to campaign for Vacca in his run for a seat on the City Council ."
574," 5847 . While some Americans disapprove of partisanship in general , others are put off by the ideology — established beliefs and ideals that help shape political policy — of one of the major parties ."
575, This is especially true among the young .
576," 5856 . For instance , Virginia established its House of Burgesses in 1619 ."
577," Upon their arrival in North America a year later , the English Separatists who settled the Plymouth Colony , commonly known as the Pilgrims , promptly authored the Mayflower Compact , an agreement to govern themselves according to the laws created by the male voters of the colony ."

580," 5961 . When economic times are good , such grants help states , cities , municipalities , and townships carry out their regular functions ."
581," However , during hard economic times , such as the Great Recession of 2007 – 2009 , intergovernmental transfers provide much - needed fiscal relief as the revenue streams of state and local governments dry up ."
582," During the Great Recession , tax receipts dropped as business activities slowed , consumer spending dropped , and family incomes decreased due to layoffs or work - hour reductions ."
583," 5988 . In the late 1800s , some states attempted to regulate working conditions ."
584," For example , New York State passed the Bakeshop Act in 1897 , which prohibited bakery employees from working more than sixty hours in a week ."
585," In Lochner v. New York , the Supreme Court ruled this state regulation that capped work hours unconstitutional , on the grounds that it violated the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment ."
586," Lochner v. New York , 198 U.S. 45 ( 1905 ) ."
587," In other words , the right to sell and buy labor is a “ liberty of the individual ” safeguarded by the Constitution , the court asserted ."
588," 6006 . The election of Ronald Reagan heralded the advent of a “ devolution revolution ” in U.S. federalism , in which the president pledged to return authority to the states according to the Constitution ."
589," In the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 , congressional leaders together with President Reagan consolidated numerous federal grant programs related to social welfare and reformulated them in order to give state and local administrators greater discretion in using federal funds ."

593," Arizona v. United States , 567 U.S. _ _ ( 2012 ) ."
594," The court struck down three of the four central provisions of the Arizona law — namely , those allowing police officers to arrest an undocumented immigrant without a warrant if they had probable cause to think he or she had committed a crime that could lead to deportation , making it a crime to seek a job without proper immigration papers , and making it a crime to be in Arizona without valid immigration papers ."
595," The court upheld the “ show me your papers ” provision , which authorizes police officers to check the immigration status of anyone they stop or arrest who they suspect is an illegal immigrant ."
596," Arizona v. United States , 567 U.S. _ _ ( 2012 ) ."
597," However , in letting this provision stand , the court warned Arizona and other states with similar laws that they could face civil rights lawsuits if police officers applied it based on racial profiling ."
598," Julia Preston , “ Arizona Ruling Only a Narrow Opening for Other States , ” New York Times , 25 June 2012 ."
599," All in all , Justice Anthony Kennedy ’s opinion embraced an expansive view of the U.S. government ’s authority to regulate immigration and aliens , describing it as broad and undoubted ."
600," 6072 . Representative John Bingham ( R - OH ) ( a ) is considered the author of the Fourteenth Amendment , adopted on July 9 , 1868 ."
601," Influenced by his mentor , Salmon P. Chase , Bingham was a strong supporter of the antislavery cause ; after Chase lost the Republican presidential nomination to Abraham Lincoln ( b ) , Bingham became one of the president ’s most ardent supporters ."
602," 6078 . For example , under the Fifth Amendment a person can be tried in federal court for a felony — a serious crime — only after a grand jury issues an indictment indicating that it is reasonable to try the person for the crime in question ."
603, ( A grand jury is a group of citizens charged with deciding whether there is enough evidence of a crime to prosecute someone . )
604," 6195 . Direct action also took such forms as the sit - in campaigns to desegregate lunch counters that began in Greensboro , North Carolina , in 1960 , and the 1961 Freedom Rides in which black and white volunteers rode buses and trains through the South to enforce a 1946 Supreme Court decision that desegregated interstate transportation ( Morgan v. Virginia ) ."
605," Morgan v. Virginia , 328 U.S. 373 ( 1946 ) ."
606," While such focused campaigns could be effective , they often had little impact in places where they were not replicated ."
607," In addition , some of the campaigns led to violence against both the campaigns ’ leaders and ordinary people ; Rosa Parks , a longtime NAACP member and graduate of the Highlander Folk School for civil rights activists , whose actions had begun the Montgomery boycott , received death threats , E. D. Nixon ’s home was bombed , and the Freedom Riders were attacked in Alabama ."
608, See Lynne Olson . 2002 .
609, 6228 . These include laws mandating equal pay for equal work .
610," According to the doctrine of comparable worth , people should be compensated equally for work requiring comparable skills , responsibilities , and effort ."
611," Thus , even though women are underrepresented in certain fields , they should receive the same wages as men if performing jobs requiring the same level of accountability , knowledge , skills , and/or working conditions , even though the specific job may be different ."
612, 6246 . The current relationship between the U.S. government and Native American tribes was established by the Indian Self - Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975 .
613," Under the act , tribes assumed control of programs that had formerly been controlled by the BIA , such as education and resource management , and the federal government provided the funding ."
614," Public Law 93 – 638 : Indian Self - Determination and Education Assistance Act , as Amended ."
615, Many tribes have also used their new freedom from government control to legalize gambling and to open casinos on their reservations .
616, 6258 . Political candidates speak at religious centers and institutions in an effort to meet like - minded voters .
617," For example , Senator Ted Cruz ( R - TX ) announced his 2016 presidential bid at Liberty University , a fundamentalist Christian institution ."
618, This university matched Cruz ’s conservative and religious ideological leanings and was intended to give him a boost from the faith - based community .
619, 6264 . Conservative governments attempt to hold tight to the traditions of a nation by balancing individual rights with the good of the community .
620," Traditional conservatism supports the authority of the monarchy and the church , believing government provides the rule of law and maintains a society that is safe and organized ."
621, Modern conservatism differs from traditional conservatism in assuming elected government will guard individual liberties and provide laws .
622," 6294 . Important political opinion leaders , or political elites , also shape public opinion , usually by serving as short - term cues that help voters pay closer attention to a political debate and make decisions about it ."

632," Included in the Federalists was President George Washington , who was initially against the existence of parties in the United States ."
633," 6525 . The Democratic Party emphasized personal politics , which focused on building direct relationships with voters rather than on promoting specific issues ."
634," This party dominated national politics from Andrew Jackson ’s presidential victory in 1828 until the mid-1850s , when regional tensions began to threaten the nation ’s very existence ."
635," 6597 . The twin disasters of the Great Depression in the 1930s and World War II , which lasted until the mid-1940s , provided President Franklin D. Roosevelt with a powerful platform from which to expand presidential power ."
636, His popularity and his ability to be elected four times allowed him to greatly overshadow Congress .
637, 6654 . Jefferson was elected president in the House of Representatives on the thirty - sixth ballot .

641," The public role of the first lady reach a new level with Hillary Clinton in the 1990s when her husband put her in charge of his efforts to achieve health care reform , a controversial decision that did not meet with political success ."
642," 6738 . While domestic policymaking requires far more give - and - take and a fair share of cajoling and collaboration , national emergencies and war offer presidents far more opportunity to act vigorously and at times independently ."
643," This phenomenon often produces the rally around the flag effect , in which presidential popularity spikes during international crises ."
644," A president must always be aware that politics , according to Otto von Bismarck , is the art of the possible , even as it is his or her duty to increase what might be possible by persuading both members of Congress and the general public of what needs to be done ."
645," 6741 . The Marriage Equality Act vote in Albany , New York , on July 24 , 2011 ( left ) , was just one of a number of cases testing the constitutionality of both federal and state law that ultimately led the Supreme Court to take on the controversial issue of same - sex marriage ."
646," In the years leading up to the 2015 ruling that same - sex couples have a right to marry in all fifty states , marriage equality had become a key civil rights issue for the LGBT community , as demonstrated at Seattle ’s 2012 Pride parade ( right ) ."
647, 6765 . But the Supreme Court has ruled in favor of all these issues and others .
648," Even without unanimous agreement among citizens , Supreme Court decisions have made all these possibilities a reality , a particularly important one for the individuals who become the beneficiaries ( [ link ] ) ."
649," 6777 . If a particular issue or topic is not taken up in one place , it may be handled in another , giving rise to many different opportunities for an interest to be heard somewhere across the nation ."
650," In their research , Paul Brace and Melinda Hall found that state courts are important instruments of democracy because they provide different alternatives and varying arenas for political access ."
651," They wrote , “ Regarding courts , one size does not fit all , and the republic has survived in part because federalism allows these critical variations . ”"
652, Paul R. Brace and Melinda Gann Hall .
653," 6792 . When a vacancy occurs in a lower federal court , by custom , the president consults with that state ’s U.S. senators before making a nomination ."
654," Through such senatorial courtesy , senators exert considerable influence on the selection of judges in their state , especially those senators who share a party affiliation with the president ."
655," In many cases , a senator can block a proposed nominee just by voicing his or her opposition ."
656," 6822 . Once a case has been placed on the docket , briefs , or short arguments explaining each party ’s view of the case , must be submitted — first by the petitioner putting forth his or her case , then by the respondent ."
657," After initial briefs have been filed , both parties may file subsequent briefs in response to the first ."
658," 6825 . The justices consider oral arguments not as a forum for a lawyer to restate the merits of his or her case as written in the briefs , but as an opportunity to get answers to any questions they may have ."
